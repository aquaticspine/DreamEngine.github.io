We are a group of 11 university students studying at Swinburne University of Technology. We are a mixture of animation & games & computer science, from the Bachelor of Games and Interactivity and Bachelor of Computer Science. This gives the team a wide variety of skills which we have combined to create the game studio Dream Engine.
