We are a group of 11 university students studying at Swinburne University of Technology. We are a mixture of animation & games & computer science, from the Bachelor of Games and Interactivity and Bachelor of Computer Science. This gives the team a wide variety of skills which we have combined to create the game studio Dream Engine.

Dream Engine has created its first game called A Friend In Me. The game has us follow Jordan and his imaginary friend Harry who used to distract Jordan from troubles and issues in his life.

The game is low poly with a colourful and bright aesthetic reinforcing the setting. This will evoke the player’s memories of childhood and fantastical daydreams, creating a feeling of nostalgia within the gameplay experience.

 Imagined elements of the game outside of the “real world” will be rendered in 2D; this will create a distinction to communicate the illusionary nature of the imaginary elements of the game to the players.

Can be played with keyboard and mouse or controller, but controller is preferred.
